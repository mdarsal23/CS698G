    "\n",
    "We have learned AES on lectures. This assignment aims to develop its practical applications and analyze security.\n",
    "You will face two kinds of questions: short-answer questions and implementation questions. They always start with a red <font color=\"red\">Question xx</font>. There are <b>14 Questions</b> in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "For short answer questions, please type your answer in the next block (by double click that block).\n",
    "\n",
    "For implementation questions, please finish the corresponding implementation by typing your code between the comments <font color=\"green\">\"You code starts\"</font> and <font color=\"green\">\"You code ends\"</font>. Please read the requiremnts carefully for each question. Unable to follow them will attract 0 marks for corresponding questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total marks for this assignment is 130, contributing as 13% to the subject marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Evaluation</b>: Your iPython notebook should run end-to-end without any errors in a reasonable amount of time, and you must follow all instructions provided below, including specific implementation requirements and instructions for what needs to be printed (please avoid printing output we don't ask for). You should edit the sections below where requested, but leave the rest of the code as is. You should leave the output from running your code in the iPython notebook you submit, to assist with marking. The amount each section is worth is given in parenthesis after the instructions. <b> You should use Python 3</b>. Our marking script is running at Python 3.10.16.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"red\">Important: Importing any library is prohibited! Using any of them will attract 0 mark for all corresponding questions!</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Academic misconduct</b>: For most people, collaboration will form a natural part of the undertaking of this homework, and we encourage you to discuss it in general terms with other students. However, this ultimately is still an individual task, and so reuse of code or other instances of clear influence will be considered cheating. We will be checking submissions for originality and will invoke the Universityâ€™s Academic Misconduct policy where inappropriate levels of collusion or plagiarism are deemed to have taken place."

The SBOX and Mixing rows never touches the original input. If there wont be an AddKey step in start, rounds would mix basic english words which can be prone to attack  due to repeatitive nature or language frequency analysis (like in monoalphabetic cipher). Further, adding a key in start makes the entire process symmetric while decrypting. Not doing that result in loss of symmetry.\n",

    "<span style=\"color:green;\">(Double click this block)</span> Your answer goes there.............................. Padding adds zero in the end of the original plaintext to make it a multiple of 16 and unpadding removes those zeros. But the problem arises when the original plaintext contains zeros in the end, then unpadding has to way to ensure whether it is removing padded zeros or original ones. This might lead to <b>loss of original data</b> \n",
    "If I pass a block of zeros of size multiple of 16, it undergoes no padding, it gets encrypted then while decrypting the unpadding process will remove the entire text which is not what we want. \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this we can either keep a variable which stores number of zeros added while padding and attach it to the end of text. It will tell how many zeros to remove while unpadding. if N zeros were padded to plaintext remove the last zero and add N to it. This way we can keep track of how many bytes of information we have to rmeove and save us from data loss. Even if there are zeros in the end of the original plaintext it wont be disturbed. and if there is an entire block of zeros the last number will suggest no bytes to remove. After this one case remains, if there is no padding and last entry is non zero then we can check if the plaintext has n-1 trailing zeros behind the last element. \n",
    "\n",
    "An edge case is if the last row has the entries in the format of suggested padding iin the original plaintext, then we precheck this and append a block of 15 zeroes and n = 15 infront of it. This prevents the eddge case.\n",

Eve can create a new message of format m1 + (m2[1] ^ T1) + m2[2] + ... + m2[n]. When CBC runs on it, in first step it processes m1 ends up with tag T1 then for next step it used the tag from previous encryption as key of next block which, here, is T1 and next block is m2[1] ^ T1, which after mixing gives back m2[i] and further steps happen the same way as it was for processing m2 individually.
